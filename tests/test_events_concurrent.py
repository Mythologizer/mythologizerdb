"""
Concurrent Events Operations Test Suite

This module contains comprehensive tests for concurrent event operations
when triggered simultaneously from different processes/threads. These tests
verify that the database operations remain consistent and reliable under
concurrent load.

Test Coverage:
- Concurrent event insertions
- Concurrent event retrievals and updates
- Mixed concurrent operations (inserts, gets, updates)
- High concurrency thread simulation
- Race condition testing

Each test verifies:
1. No errors occur during concurrent operations
2. Data integrity is maintained
3. All operations complete successfully
4. Final state is consistent and expected
5. Individual queries return valid data
6. No duplicate events are processed
7. Events are processed in correct order

These tests are critical for ensuring the events system can handle real-world
scenarios where multiple processes or threads are performing operations
simultaneously.
