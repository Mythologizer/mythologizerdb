"""
Concurrent Operations Test Suite

This module contains comprehensive tests for concurrent mutations and queries
when triggered simultaneously from different processes/threads. These tests
verify that the database operations remain consistent and reliable under
concurrent load.

Test Coverage:
- Concurrent myth insertions and queries
- Concurrent mytheme operations
- Concurrent updates and queries
- Concurrent bulk operations
- Concurrent epoch operations
- Mixed operations (inserts, updates, queries, deletes)
- High concurrency thread simulation

Each test verifies:
1. No errors occur during concurrent operations
2. Data integrity is maintained
3. All operations complete successfully
4. Final state is consistent and expected
5. Individual queries return valid data

These tests are critical for ensuring the database can handle real-world
scenarios where multiple processes or threads are performing operations
simultaneously.
