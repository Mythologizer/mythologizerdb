-- Get Myth by ID Query
-- Retrieves a single myth by its unique identifier
-- 
-- Purpose: Fetch a specific myth record using its primary key
-- 
-- Parameters:
--   {{ myth_id }} - The ID of the myth to retrieve (Jinja2 template variable)
--
-- Returns: Complete myth record if found
-- 
-- Columns returned:
--   - id: Unique identifier for the myth
--   - embedding: Vector representation of the myth (VECTOR type)
--   - embedding_ids: Array of integer IDs associated with the myth
--   - offsets: Array of vector offsets for the myth
--   - weights: Array of double precision weights for the myth
--   - created_at: Timestamp when the myth was created
--   - updated_at: Timestamp when the myth was last updated
--
-- Example usage:
--   SELECT id, embedding, embedding_ids, offsets, weights, created_at, updated_at
--   FROM myths
--   WHERE id = 1;
--
-- Note: This query is useful for retrieving specific myths for processing,
-- analysis, or display purposes. The embedding and related vector data
-- can be used for similarity calculations and AI processing.

SELECT id, embedding, embedding_ids, offsets, weights, created_at, updated_at
FROM myths
WHERE id = {{ myth_id }};
