-- Get All Myths Query
-- Retrieves all myths from the myths table
-- 
-- Purpose: Fetch all myth records for bulk processing or analysis
-- 
-- Returns: All myth records in the database
-- 
-- Columns returned:
--   - id: Unique identifier for each myth
--   - embedding: Vector representation of each myth (VECTOR type)
--   - embedding_ids: Array of integer IDs associated with each myth
--   - offsets: Array of vector offsets for each myth
--   - weights: Array of double precision weights for each myth
--   - created_at: Timestamp when each myth was created
--   - updated_at: Timestamp when each myth was last updated
--
-- Ordering: Results are ordered by ID for consistent retrieval
--
-- Example usage:
--   SELECT id, embedding, embedding_ids, offsets, weights, created_at, updated_at
--   FROM myths
--   ORDER BY id;
--
-- Note: This query returns all myths and should be used carefully
-- in production environments with large datasets. Consider using
-- pagination or filtering for better performance with large myth collections.
-- Useful for bulk operations like embedding analysis, data migration,
-- or comprehensive myth cataloging.
