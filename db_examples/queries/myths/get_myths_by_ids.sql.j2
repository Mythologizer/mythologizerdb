-- Get Myths by IDs Query
-- Retrieves multiple myths by their IDs using an IN clause
-- 
-- Purpose: Fetch specific myth records using a list of primary keys
-- 
-- Parameters:
--   {{ myth_ids }} - Array of myth IDs to retrieve (Jinja2 template variable)
--
-- Returns: Myth records matching the provided IDs
-- 
-- Columns returned:
--   - id: Unique identifier for each myth
--   - embedding: Vector representation of each myth (VECTOR type)
--   - embedding_ids: Array of integer IDs associated with each myth
--   - offsets: Array of vector offsets for each myth
--   - weights: Array of double precision weights for each myth
--   - created_at: Timestamp when each myth was created
--   - updated_at: Timestamp when each myth was last updated
--
-- Ordering: Results are ordered by ID for consistent retrieval
--
-- Example usage:
--   SELECT id, embedding, embedding_ids, offsets, weights, created_at, updated_at
--   FROM myths
--   WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3)
--   ORDER BY id;
--
-- Note: This query is useful for retrieving specific subsets of myths
-- for batch processing, analysis, or when you have a known set of
-- myth IDs. The IN clause provides efficient retrieval of multiple
-- records. Consider the size of the myth_ids array to avoid overly
-- large queries.

SELECT id, embedding, embedding_ids, offsets, weights, created_at, updated_at
FROM myths
WHERE id IN ({{ myth_ids | join(', ') }})
ORDER BY id;
